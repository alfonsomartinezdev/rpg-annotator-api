<h1>MARVEL HEROIC RPG - OPERATIONS MANUAL</h1>

<h2>02 PLAYING THE GAME</h2>

<p>In the MARVEL HEROIC ROLEPLAYING game, most of the action takes place in Scenes involving the heroes being challenged by some kind of opposition. Just like in the comics, the action is broken down into moments of decision, drama, and doom. Between these Action Scenes are Transition Scenes, when the players engage in exposition, recovery, or reflection.</p>

<p>This game is played in game sessions, which might range from a couple of hours to a whole day, depending on the group. Because a game session can be so variable, time within the game is tracked by Events, Acts, Scenes, and Panels. This lingo comes from film, TV, and comic books, all of which are very visual media. You could even think of published MARVEL HEROIC ROLEPLAYING Events as the game equivalent of a comic book script.</p>

<hr>

<h2>EVENT</h2>

<p>An Event is a <strong>single, overarching storyline</strong> involving multiple story threads with many different characters. At least one super hero team is central to it, although there are usually teams, solo heroes, and other supporting characters all playing a part. The Super Hero Civil War, the Age of Apocalypse, and the Secret Invasion of the Skrulls are Events. Not every Event needs to be as far-reaching or massive in scope. Most Events could be described best as story arcs, such as the Necrosha Event that involved the X-Men.</p>

<p>In most MARVEL HEROIC ROLEPLAYING games, an Event is the length of the story. The players choose their heroes at the beginning of the Event, unlock cool powers, locations, and story hooks along the way, and then retire the hero at the end. When the next Event starts, they might take the same hero (maybe with a new datafile) and move them forward, or choose a new one, based on the Event in question.</p>

<h2>ACT</h2>

<p>Each Event is made up of at least two Acts, like the acts in a play or movie script. An Act represents a chunk of time with multiple Scenes, all <strong>leading up to some pivotal point or moment</strong>. In a typical Event, the final Act ends in the climactic battle with the villainous threat as the heroes overcome whatever mighty challenge presented itself earlier in the story. The number of Acts it takes to get to that point can vary, but three is the standard.</p>

<p>In every Act, the doom pool grows, gets used, and grows some more. Each Act begins with the doom pool reset to a starting number of dice, which means that at the end of an Act the doom dice are spent by the Watcher on unlocking certain triggered conditions, introducing new threats, and so on. In fact, the size of the doom pool or the dice in it might trigger the point at which the final Scene of an Act takes place. Acts may also be connected strongly to a hero's Milestones. See page OM105 for more information on Milestones.</p>

<hr>

<h2>SCENE</h2>

<p>A Scene is a period of time centered on a <strong>single conflict or situation</strong>. It might not involve all of the heroes—sometimes it only involves one or two of them. A Scene should focus on answering a question, resolving a problem, or settling a dispute or exchange. The game considers two types of Scenes. <strong>Action Scenes</strong> involve the characters doing something to drive the story along and move it forward. <strong>Transition Scenes</strong> connect Action Scenes together and are usually used to recover, gather information, or plan the next Scene.</p>

<p>As the Watcher, framing every Scene is your responsibility—we'll talk more about that in just a moment—although the players might suggest what comes next in the story. A Scene ends when the central conflict or situation is resolved; this means you need to have a sense of what the Scene is about as you frame it. It's often as simple as saying "Okay, so the next day you're at the site of the last Purifier attack, and you find a wounded Purifier being dragged away by some Morlocks. He's sure to have the security codes you need to shut down the Purifier's orbital platform. Are you going to stop the Morlocks?" The implication here is that this Scene is about this wounded Purifier, the information he has, and the Morlocks that want to finish him off. The Scene ends when that's been resolved somehow.</p>

<h2>PANEL</h2>

<p>A Panel is a moment in the Scene, usually encompassing a <strong>single character's action or effort to do something</strong>. It's a helpful visual reference when you're describing what a character does, because if it can fit into a panel in a comic book, it's doable with a character's action. Even if there are other characters involved in a Panel, the spotlight is on one of them, the one whose turn it is in the action order. Everyone else is supporting you, opposing you, or off in the background.</p>

<p>There are as many Panels in a Scene as there need to be to resolve the Scene's problem or conflict. Even if the Watcher and players are just sitting around acting out their characters without rolling dice, we can assume this is taking place in Panels. For practical purposes, a Panel starts when a player picks up the dice and declares his intent, and it ends when the action he's taking is resolved.</p>

<p>As the Watcher you can also prematurely end a Scene before it's resolved using the doom pool, usually to move things along. If this happens, you should consider whether the player heroes were close to resolving it successfully or not. If they were, let them summarize the outcome and establish those truths in the story. If they weren't, you do the honors, and move on to the next Scene, where they deal with the fallout.</p>

<hr>

<h2>ACTION SCENES</h2>

<p>Some Scenes are more investigatory in nature or revolve around more social or personal activity, but they are Action Scenes in their own right. A pitched battle across the frozen wastes of Jotunheim and a tense diplomatic meeting between agents of the Shi'ar and Kree empires are both examples of Action Scenes. An Action Scene might begin <em>in medias res</em>, in the middle of the action—Thor and his Warriors Three are already in the midst of a titanic battle with Frost Giants, or Cyclops and the X-Men are already three hours into the middle of the diplomatic encounter. What's important is that this is where the real action starts.</p>

<h3>FRAMING ACTION SCENES</h3>

<p>If you're the Watcher, you get things started by establishing who is present in a Scene and where. This is called <strong>framing the Scene</strong>, and it's your chief responsibility in the game—other than playing the bad guys, keeping the doom pool, and rolling opposition dice. You should ask directed questions of the players, encouraging them to describe what their hero is doing or how they plan to respond to something. Rather than asking, "Where are you?" try something like, "Are you in the middle of the rank-and-file, or are you with the officers near the rear?" You might even establish a particular fact at the same time: "You're with the officers of the Imperial Force. How did you agree to this position?"</p>

<p>If you're a player, you should allow for some relaxation of control over your hero for this purpose, because after this point everything you do and say is up to you and the roll of the dice. If the Watcher asks you, "How did you agree to this position?" use that as an opportunity to build on the story. You might say, "Cyclops wants to see the big picture, so he's staying back to be sure his tactical genius is put to good use." Or, "Cyclops doesn't trust the Shi'ar officers, so he's staying near them in case they decide to pull a fast one on his team."</p>

<hr>

<h3>PRESENTING THE CHALLENGE</h3>

<p>Once you frame a Scene as the Watcher, it's time to present the challenge to the players. Sometimes, this is a villain or mob of bad guys. Other times, it's a family of four trapped in a burning building. You're encouraging the players to think about how they're going to respond to something immediate and exciting. Action Scenes are no place for slow deliberation. Get right to it and present the problem! You can frame this as a question, as well: "Ronan the Accuser steps in front of his Kree soldiers and demands your head! How do you react to his threat?" Or, "Ronan hurls a blast of cosmic energy from his Universal Weapon at you, signaling the end of peaceful negotiations! How do you defend yourself?"</p>

<p>As a player, you now have the core situation—or at least the implication of one—laid out in front of you for this Scene. It's time to drop into character, think about what your hero would do in this situation, and perhaps talk it over with the other players. Some groups of players are hardcore and won't allow "table talk"—players giving suggestions to each other even when their own heroes aren't present in the same Scene—but others are more relaxed. What matters is that you're engaged with the new challenge and ready to go.</p>

<h3>WHO GOES FIRST?</h3>

<p>Imagine a page in a comic book, with multiple panels in it where each hero pulls off his amazing stunt or swings into action against the villain. A series of actions in the game is like this, with each hero getting a Panel—a moment when all of the attention is on him. The same is usually true of the villains, although often the villains' thugs and supporting characters tend to just act all at once—a menacing mob of mooks swarming over the heroes.</p>

<p>Once the Scene has been introduced to the players and the challenges are made clear, it's time to swing the spotlight around. <strong>One of the players gets to go first, chosen by</strong> the Watcher based on the description of the Scene or by the consensus of the group. Quite often, this is the central leader hero, or the fastest one, or the one played by the player who speaks up first! If you're the Watcher, you might decide this when you frame the Scene. Otherwise, go with who makes the most sense.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I'm playing Captain America. Spider-Man, Black Widow, and Cap have arrived at a Texas-style steak house that's apparently a cover for a crime syndicate in New York. The Watcher frames a Scene in which a scuffle is breaking out between some restaurant guests, one of whom looks like a seedy character we've already heard about. I announce that I'm going to do something, which means I'm first up in the action order. It could be that Black Widow's player or Spidey's player wants to go before me; if that's the case, we'll have a quick chat about it. The Watcher will settle the score if we can't.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h3>WHO GOES NEXT?</h3>

<p>Everyone gets a Panel of their own to act, and this string of Panels is called the <strong>action order</strong>. Once the first character has acted—whether it's a player hero or a Watcher character—the action order has begun. <strong>It's the player of the character who just acted that determines who goes next.</strong> As the Watcher, your job is to wrangle all of this, but don't worry—it's not as difficult as you might think. All you need to do is pose the question to the player, "Who's next?"</p>

<p>As a player, you have a choice between another hero or one of the Watcher's characters. It might work to your advantage to choose the opposition next. Why? Well, apart from making the story flow better or seeing what the villain has planned and then being able to let somebody else respond to it, <strong>the player in control of the last character to act in any action order chooses who goes first at the top of the next action order</strong>. So if you'd like that to be a player's responsibility, have a player hero go last.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I'm playing Captain America and the Watcher ambushed the team with a group of Hydra agents. After they take their action, the Watcher picks me to go next. After my action, which I used to knock away a bunch of the goons with my shield, I turn to the other two players. We agree that Black Widow's going next, and she's going to pick the seedy character we saw when we arrived to go next, since it's obvious he's a Watcher character. That leaves Spidey, assuming the Watcher has no more surprises in store for us. Once Spidey takes his action, he can choose who starts the next action order.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're the Watcher and you want one of your own characters to go first, you need to spend doom to do it. It costs at least a D6 doom die—if there's a hero at the table with ENHANCED, SUPERHUMAN, or GODLIKE SENSES or REFLEXES and you don't have a character with SENSES or REFLEXES of that die rating, you need to match either their SENSES or REFLEXES die with a doom die of the same size. Whether it's SENSES or REFLEXES depends on the framing of the Scene; typically, surprise attacks, ambushes, and sudden arrivals hinge on SENSES, while a sudden attack from a foe that's already present and engaged with the heroes would be REFLEXES.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I'm the Watcher and I've decided that Spider-Man, Black Widow, and Captain America are going to be ambushed at the steak house by a group of Hydra agents. Rather than let one of the players go first, I'm spending from the doom pool to give Hydra the jump on the heroes. First I need to check with the players to see who has the highest SENSES power trait, since this is an ambush. Looks like that's Spider-Man with ENHANCED SENSES D8. I need to spend a D8 or larger from the doom pool to have the Hydra agents go first. Hail Hydra!</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h3>KEEPING TRACK OF THE ACTION ORDER</h3>

<p>If a lot of characters are involved in an Action Scene, it can be easy to lose track of who's gone and who hasn't. There are a lot of ways we've found to keep track of this, but one of the easiest is to have each player keep a two-sided token—a coin, a playing card, or something like that—in front of them during the Scene. As the Watcher, you need something for each of your characters or groups of characters (in the case of mobs of Hydra agents, Hand ninjas, and so on). If you want to be really flavorful, use cards with the character's image on one side and nothing on the other side. You might even use action figures, miniatures, or folded cardboard standees.</p>

<p>When the action order starts, everyone puts their token in front of them facing up. After your character acts and it's time to pick the next character to act, turn your token over (or lay it on its side, or whatever seems appropriate) so that it's clear you've acted. It should be possible for everyone at the table to glance at you and see whether you've acted in the action order or not.</p>

<p>Once everyone has taken an action and it's time for a new action order, flip all the tokens or cards up and go again!</p>

<h3>INTERRUPTING THE ACTION ORDER</h3>

<p>As the Watcher, you can interrupt the action order at any point using doom dice. If a player chooses another player to go, you can spend a die out of the doom pool to have one of your characters act before that next player. Just like the use of doom dice to seize the control of the first Panel in the action order, you have to spend at least a D6 to do this. If the interrupted player has a hero with ENHANCED or greater REFLEXES or SENSES, you have to match that with your Watcher character's own powers or spend a larger die.</p>

<p>You can also interrupt the action order with doom dice to introduce threats that weren't there before (like another group of Hydra agents smashing through the steak house windows), to split the group up with some kind of explosive effect or twist, or anything else that may potentially cause a break in the action. In each case, the same restrictions apply—you have to match the REFLEXES or SENSES, or spend a larger doom die.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I'm the Watcher. Black Widow's about to go next as Captain America's player has chosen her. If I decide that I'm going to make the seedy crime syndicate guy go next, now would be a good time to do it, but Black Widow has ENHANCED REFLEXES D8, and the seedy guy's already in the Scene. If I wanted to throw in more Hydra agents, or even the Hydra leader Baron Strucker, then that would be against SENSES, and Black Widow's Power Sets don't give her any edge in that department. In the end, I decide I'm just going to wait and see which character Black Widow's player picks next. I'll save the Baron for later...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you interrupt a hero with doom dice, make sure that you flip over the action order marker for the character you interrupted with before the interrupted hero takes an action. An interrupting character doesn't get to go later in the action order; you've basically just cut in line.</p>

<hr>

<h3>WHEN ARE WE DONE?</h3>

<p>You can run through multiple action orders in a Scene—usually you'll have to in order for everyone to achieve what they're trying to do. Most Scenes run through the action order three or four times, especially in a big battle or a tense confrontation. Just have the last active player (or you, as the Watcher) call out the first active player in the next action order. If you're using flipcards or some other kind of indicator to show whether characters have acted in the action order, reset them.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you can set aside the action order for a few minutes while there's a break in the action. Maybe the players want to roleplay their heroes for a bit as they're crouched behind the remains of a water tower, planning their next move. Maybe the villains broke away and are hiding, ready to spring at the heroes. Or maybe you just want to play out some banter between the team leader and the villain while the others take a breather. As soon as the action picks up again, go the top of the action order and carry on!</p>

<p>Typically, the Scene itself ends in one of two ways. Either the heroes stop the villains, avert disaster, and claim victory over the challenge, or the alternative happens. In either case, the situation is resolved, even if it's not how the players might like! The Watcher summarizes the action so far, touches base with each player to note where his or her hero ended up, and then frames the next Scene.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The Scene with the seedy character in the steak house and the Hydra agents has a pretty simple conflict: Cap, Spidey, and Black Widow have to take care of the Hydra agents so they can find out what's going on from the seedy crime syndicate guy. The Scene's over once the agents are all knocked out or chased off, so we can play through a few Action Scenes until that's done. Given the level of opposition, that's not going to take too long!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most Action Scenes are followed by a Transition Scene, linking one period of activity to another. This isn't always the case, of course. Sometimes an Action Scene leads directly to another one, with the stakes raised even higher.</p>

<h3>Using the Doom Pool to End the Scene</h3>

<p>As the Watcher, you can always cut the Scene early—before the problem or conflict has been resolved—by spending 2D12 out of the doom pool and handing out 2 XP to each affected player. If you do this when the heroes are looking good and the villains are on the ropes, ask the players how they want to wrap it up. Ask questions just like you do at the beginning of a Scene. If a major villain's involved, present a tough choice to the heroes, though make it clear that they've won something even if the villain's presence colors it somewhat.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>"So the Hydra agents are running scared. How long does it take you to round them up? How many of them escape?"</p>

    <p>"Baron Strucker's clutching his side and hurling insults at you as his forces disperse. You can capture him, or you can stop his troops from getting away with the crime syndicate leader. What do you do?"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If, on the other hand, you spend the 2D12 when the Scene is going against the heroes, or they're struggling against insurmountable odds, you can bring the Scene to a close and invite the players to describe how they lost or what they had to sacrifice. Either way, things are going to heat up.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>"The Hydra forces have you surrounded and you're at Baron Strucker's mercy. Which one of you escapes their clutches?"</p>

    <p>"The crime syndicate leader has escaped and the Hydra forces have all scattered. The steak house is on fire and collapsing all around you. How did you get out of there, and what else did it cost you?"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bringing the players in on this underscores how important they are as the writer/artist of their heroes, while still making it clear that the doom pool brought this about.</p>

<h2>TRANSITION SCENES</h2>

<p>Action and adventure is what most of us think of when we imagine a super hero story set in the Marvel Universe, but these stories are more than just big brawls and conflict. Between these Scenes, linking them together are Scenes of reflection, recovery, and regrouping. We call these <strong>Transition Scenes</strong>, and they allow the characters involved to do something with what they've learned before the next conflict is met head-on.</p>

<p>As well as being used for recovery actions, a Transition Scene's purpose is to determine what the next Action Scene is. If this is already settled, then the Transition Scene helps to put that into context.</p>

<h3>FRAMING TRANSITION SCENES</h3>

<p>As the Watcher, it's your responsibility to frame Transition Scenes just like you would any Action Scene. Start out by asking directed questions of the players. You want them to decide what their heroes are doing and how they're using their resources before they start into the next dramatic Action Scene, so put them in a situation that's not as charged with conflict; instead, open up options to roleplay and talk with each other or with support characters.</p>

<p>You might lead with something like:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>"It's the next morning on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. You've got the leader of the crime syndicate in lockup, but now you know Hydra's involved. What's Captain America doing to track down the Hydra agents? What's Black Widow going to do with the crime syndicate leader? And does Spidey check in with Mary Jane to let her know he might have to skip her play this evening?"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a player, Transition Scenes are where your hero recovers stress, follows up any information collected in the last Scene, and reaches out to new heroes and support characters. When the Watcher leads off with a question, make it clear what you want your hero to do.</p>

<hr>

<h3>RECOVERY ACTIONS</h3>

<p>They're called actions because they're one of the things you can try to do in the middle of an Action Scene, but Transition Scenes tend to be the most effective time to use recovery actions. First, all of your hero's stress steps back by one at the start of a Transition Scene, which makes it easier to recover the rest of it. Second, you don't have villains and thugs and other threats complicating things. And third, you can make use of your allies with recovery-based powers by spending Plot Points, which has the added benefit of giving your allies more PP.</p>

<p>You can't attempt to recover a specific type of stress more than once in any Transition Scene. It's assumed that this action represents all of your efforts at getting better before the next Scene starts. You can, however, try to recover different types of stress, and you can make the best use of your Plot Points and assistance from others if you use multiple effect dice to recover more than one type of stress in a single action. For more information on stress and recovery actions, see page OM53.</p>

<p>If you've taken trauma after being stressed out in the previous Action Scene, you can't recover all of it in the space of time a Transition Scene generally covers. Recovery actions used for trauma can only step back the die by one, and carry a risk of stepping up the trauma as well. There are exceptions, of course, such as heroes with amazing recuperative powers like Wolverine or Deadpool. Trauma recovery can be taken care of with a specific Milestone, during which your hero can also earn XP. See page OM27 for more on trauma, and page OM105 for more information on Milestones.</p>

<p>You can use a recovery action to get rid of a lingering complication, too, if you can justify it. Instead of stepping back or eliminating a stress die, you're stepping back or eliminating a complication die. The Watcher may also just declare that the complication no longer exists, especially if it was entirely dependent on a situation that's ended.</p>

<h3>RECRUITMENT</h3>

<p>You can use the downtime of a Transition Scene to play out the <strong>recruitment of a new hero</strong> to the story, which is great if a new player shows up to the game and wants to play. While there's nothing keeping a hero from just showing up in the middle of an Action Scene, that requires something like SPEED, FLIGHT, TELEPORTATION, or some other super-power to explain why they've just arrived. Also, if your group likes to have multiple heroes in the control of each player (also known as troupe style play) the Transition Scene is a good place to switch out your hero datafile with another one.</p>

<p>Your hero may also spend PP to <strong>recruit resources</strong> connected to a Specialty during a Transition Scene. This represents the hero calling in favors, reaching out to connections, doing research on something related to the Specialty, or identifying important details about a location you're expecting to go to. Any resource created must fall under the Specialty in question.</p>

<h3>REGROUPING</h3>

<p>Some Scenes involve the team splitting up to more than one location. While that can continue during the Transition Scene as heroes go off by themselves to get better or hang out with one or two others, the Transition Scene is a good time to play out the gathering together of the team and have them all touch base with each other.</p>

<p>It can give the Watcher a better sense of which heroes may be together at the beginning of the next Action Scene, too, if you establish within the story that your heroes are planning on being in one or more groups to face whatever challenges next arise.</p>

<h3>RELOCATION</h3>

<p>One use of Transition Scenes is to describe what the heroes are doing in transit to a new location. It's easy to skip ahead and just describe the next Action Scene as being in Los Angeles or Cuba or the Blue Area of the Moon, but as the Watcher you have an opportunity to bring this to the players' attention and have them make choices.</p>

<p>Sometimes the next Action Scene's location isn't settled until there's a Transition Scene that centers on that decision. As a player, how does your hero plan to pursue the team's foes? Where does the team expect to find the hidden base? Who do you want to take with you on the trip, and what will that involve? Have you been there before (and if so, are you going to spend PP on getting an information-based resource die for it) or are you going in blind?</p>

<h3>ROLEPLAYING</h3>

<p>Finally, the Transition Scene is a great excuse to really get into those sorts of purely roleplayed conversations with other characters that don't have much to do with powers, battles, investigation, or adventure, but give context to your hero and the world around him. Whether it's time spent in your hero's secret identity, reassuring loved ones that you're still alive, or enjoying a pizza with heroes who aren't even in the story (special guest stars?), Transition Scenes give you a moment to put those subplots in the spotlight.</p>

<p>From a gameplay perspective, many of a hero's Milestones hook into the activity that takes place outside of Action Scenes, so Transition Scenes are ideal for earning XP and moving toward your Milestone. For more on Milestones, see page OM105.</p>
