<h1>MARVEL HEROIC RPG - OPERATIONS MANUAL</h1>

<h2>03 TAKING ACTION</h2>

<p>Let's assume you're reading this book in order—since you read the Introduction, you already know how to roll dice, add dice together for a total, and choose an effect die. In Playing the Game you read about how Action Scenes and Transition Scenes work and flow together. This section expands on the basic rules and tells you how the game rules interact with each other in those action and Transition Scenes.</p>

<p>Remember, one of the core rules of the game is that you don't need to use the dice unless there's some kind of interesting outcome for both success and failure. During the game, your heroes face plenty of challenges, engage in innumerable conflicts, and both succeed and fail repeatedly. It's the nature of comic book adventure, right? But if nothing's at stake, there's no real risk, and failure would be boring, the Watcher should just say, "Yep, that works," and move on.</p>

<p>By default, the person who picks up the dice is the active side of any conflict. Picking up the dice means, "I want to do this thing." If a player's describing something he wants to do and hasn't picked up dice, the Watcher can nudge this along with a question, like, "What traits are you going to use to do that?" or "What are the ways this can go?" The Watcher may also be the one to pick up the dice, which is another way of saying, "What have you got? What are you going to do about this?"</p>

<hr>

<h2>IT'S CLOBBERIN' TIME!</h2>

<p>Open any Marvel comic book or graphic novel and you're likely to see action spread across multiple pages and panels, with the heroes at odds with the villains while innocent bystanders dive out of the way. The tension finally snaps; the optic blasts, adamantium claws, and big rocky fists come out; buildings shake, the sidewalk shudders, and you know that it's definitely time for a super hero battle.</p>

<p>This section is primarily weighted toward classic comic book battles, but that's only one side of comic book conflict. Your heroes may also get involved in tense emotional or mental confrontations using these same rules.</p>

<h3>MAKE YOUR INTENT CLEAR</h3>

<p>As a player, when it's time for your action, you need to make your intent as clear as possible to the Watcher and other players before you even pick up the dice. If you've said what you want to do, make sure you're suggesting what you want out of the action. The Watcher might suggest the alternative outcome—i.e., what happens if you don't succeed at your action—but you can also define this from the outset. Knowing what you want if you succeed and what you think will happen if you don't is key to the next step.</p>

<p>If you're the Watcher, you need to do the same thing. Be shamelessly transparent. There's no sense in hiding from the players what the outcomes might be; they're partners in telling the story, too. It helps knowing how high the stakes are before the dice are rolled!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let's go back to Cyclops and Emma, who have arrived at their next mission zone and are confronting a pair of Sentinels. I'm playing Cyclops, so I want to use my FORCE BLAST power to take out a Sentinel. That's a nice, clear intent. What's the alternative outcome? Well, the Sentinel will probably close in on me and that won't be great. Either way, things are going to heat up.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h3>GATHER YOUR DICE</h3>

<p>Pick up all the dice that are appropriate for the action. If you're a player, always start with an Affiliation die based on your hero's current situation—SOLO, BUDDY, or TEAM. Next, check to see if there's a Distinction that fits the occasion and whether it's going to help or hinder your hero. For each action, you may choose one power from each Power Set and one Specialty without paying PP to add them to your pool. By choosing these traits you're saying, "These things have an impact on what I do!"</p>

<p>You can spend Plot Points to add in stunt dice as desired. If there are SFX that might be useful, like Captain America's RICOCHET, this is where it's used. Once you've settled the dice pool, roll the dice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My opening move as Cyclops is to blast at one of the Sentinels with a touch of my ruby-quartz visor. Now I need to gather my dice pool. I'm with Emma, so I pick up my D8 BUDDY die. I've got the TACTICAL GENIUS Distinction, which is a D8, and COMBAT EXPERT, which I'm using as D10. Finally, I have my FORCE BLAST D10. So my dice pool is:</p>

<p>I've also got 2 PP on hand:</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>TRAITS YOU CAN ADD TO YOUR DICE POOL:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>One Affiliation die</li>
<li>One Distinction, either as a D8 or a D4</li>
<li>One power from each of your Power Sets</li>
<li>One Specialty</li>
<li>One of your opposition's stress or complication dice, if any</li>
<li>One asset, if any</li>
<li>One push die, stunt, or resource, if any</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>FIND THE TOTAL AND EFFECT DIE</h3>

<p>Roll the dice. Choose two dice and add them together as your total. Any dice that come up 1 are opportunities and they're set aside. At this point, you can spend a Plot Point to include a third die from the remaining dice on the table—you can add as many dice to the total as you have Plot Points you want to spend. Then announce the total. If there are dice remaining, choose one to use as the effect die. If there are no more dice, the effect die is a D4.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I roll the dice and get:</p>

<p>I set aside the D6 with the 1; that's an opportunity. The Watcher activates it, adding a D6 to the doom pool and handing me a PP, bringing my total up to 3 PP.</p>

<p>Taking two dice and adding them together, my total is 18.</p>

<p>TOTAL: 18</p>

<p>I could spend a PP to kick that up to 14 by using either the D10 or the D8. It's my choice, and I'd rather leave the D10 out as my effect die, so I choose to add in the D8. My total is 16, my effect die is a D10, and I have 2 PP remaining.</p>

<p>TOTAL: 16 EFFECT: D10</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h3>THE REACTION ROLL</h3>

<p>After you've rolled the dice for the action and there's a total and an effect die, your opponent gets to roll a reaction. The opposition gathers dice and makes a dice pool, same as the side that's taking action. The choice of traits to draw on here should reflect that it's a reaction to the acting player's attempt to do something. The reacting side describes what this response is, like "Cap's raising his shield and deflecting the blow" or "Storm's whipping up a whirlwind to push the Purifier back."</p>

<p>It's important to know the nature of the reaction, because this not only determines what traits to use but what happens next.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As Watcher, I state that the Sentinel is just going to advance on Cyclops, soaking up the damage on account of it having advanced shielding and armored plate. That's EXPERT SENTINEL D8, BUDDY D8 (the Sentinel is one of two in the Scene) and SUPERHUMAN DURABILITY D10, plus a D6 doom die that I pull from the doom pool.</p>

<p>With a roll of:</p>

<p>...that's a total of 17—greater than Cyclops's total—and a D6 effect die (I can't choose the D8 because it rolled a 1).</p>

<p>TOTAL: 17 EFFECT: D6</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>WATCHER ACTIONS</h4>

<p>If you're the Watcher and you're taking action with one of your characters—a villain launching a surprise attack or trying to strike terror into the heroes—the dice might be different. A major villain has a datafile that's pretty similar to the hero datafiles. But other Watcher datafiles are usually shorter and don't have the same level of detail as the player heroes. Usually it's a broad Specialty that sums up the character's profession, role, or primary talent, followed by Affiliation dice and any super-powers, weapons, or specialized traits. The doom pool is always available as a source of additional dice. Once your pool is settled, pick up all the dice and roll them.</p>

<pre>
<strong>Expert Sentinel</strong> 
SOLO <em>D10</em> 
BUDDY <em>D8</em> 
TEAM <em>D6</em> 

SUPERHUMAN STRENGTH <em>D10</em> 
SUPERHUMAN DURABILITY <em>D10</em> 
ENERGY BEAM PROJECTOR <em>D10</em> 
ENHANCED SENSES <em>D8</em>

<strong>SFX:</strong> Adaptive Learning. Add D6 to dice pool for each failed action against a superhuman opponent. 
<strong>Limit:</strong> Robotic Systems. On electromagnetic attack, shutdown a trait and gain D6 doom.
</pre>

<h4>NARRATING FAILURE</h4>

<p>Don't let failure bring you down. This game is all about action, sure, but it's also about making tough choices and accepting the consequences. If you're a player and the Watcher's reaction total beats yours, the story doesn't remain static. How does the Watcher describe the villain's defense against your mighty attack? Where did the villain end up? Where is your hero after the action?</p>

<p>As the Watcher, make sure to keep the description of the action going. Ask the players what happens when their hero fails to blast the Sentinels or if their reaction to the Sentinel's energy beams isn't enough to stop them. Ask those questions, and keep things moving at a good clip.</p>

<hr>

<h3>RESOLVING ACTION</h3>

<p>Once you have the two totals (action and reaction) you can compare them to each other. You're looking to see if your opponent's reaction total is greater than your action total. If this is the case, your action fails. Don't worry about your effect die, because it won't be used.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I'm playing Cyclops, and the Watcher rolled a higher total than I did as a reaction. This means Cyclops's optic beam had no luck against the Sentinel's armor. I don't get to use my effect die to do anything, so it's time to choose who goes next in the action order.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>If the reaction total is equal to or lower than your action total, your action succeeds.</strong> You can use your effect die to create an effect: stress, an asset, or a complication. If you have more than one effect die (you spend PP to keep more, or you have SFX in one of your Power Sets that give you more), you can create multiple effects. If you're trying to inflict stress or a complication, you have to first compare the effect die against the effect die of the reacting side. <strong>If the reaction effect die is larger than yours, you have to step back your effect die by one.</strong> In other words, they have at least a little defense up against you. This isn't an issue if you're only creating an asset.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the Watcher hadn't rolled a higher total for the Sentinel than my action total for Cyclops, I'd be able to use my effect die for stress. My effect die is D10, which is higher than the Sentinel's D6 effect die, so I wouldn't have had to step back the effect. Inflicting D10 of physical stress on the Sentinel would have been a big plus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If your action fails, your opponent may spend a Plot Point (if a player) or a D6 or larger from the doom pool (if the Watcher) to create an effect, just as you would have had you succeeded on your action.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the Watcher, I could decide to use my doom pool to jump on that failed action. For the cost of a D6 out of the pool, I can use the Sentinel's D6 effect die to create some kind of asset, inflict stress on Cyclops, or introduce some kind of complication. Luckily for Cyclops's player, I decide not to worry about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>

<h3>EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS</h3>

<p>If your action total is 5 or more points higher than your opponent's reaction total, you've gained an <strong>extraordinary success</strong>. This lets you step up your effect die by one and describe just how amazing your efforts were. For every additional 5-point increment, you can step your effect die up again. By this method, it's possible to step an effect die up past D12, in which case you can either declare that you've automatically stressed out your opponent (if you were trying to inflict stress) or you can use a second remaining die from your roll as an effect die.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As Cyclops's player, what if I'd succeeded against the Sentinel by 5 points in the last action? I could have delivered a D12 effect on the Sentinel and would be that much closer to stressing it out. If my total were 10 points higher, that would be a single hit takedown.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that there's no such thing as an extraordinary failure, but if your opponent does have a reaction total of 5 or more greater than yours, he can consider it an extraordinary success on his part. What does this mean? If he's spent a PP (or doom die) to use his own effect die, he can step it up just as you could, had you rolled an extraordinary success of your own.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As the Watcher, I could have spent a D6 out of the pool to use the Sentinel's D6 effect die to create some kind of asset, stress, or complication against Cyclops. If my reaction total had been 5 points higher than his action, the D6 would be stepped up to a D8. If it had been 10 points higher, that'd be a D10.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h3>DIVIDING YOUR ATTENTION</h3>

<p>Let's say you want to take out more than one target at once or do more than one thing at a time. Generally in a comic book panel, a super hero can be assumed to be moving into position, calling out something, or any number of other minor actions. Those are free and shouldn't be a big deal. What does matter is when you want to actively do two or more things with the same roll. The key here is broadcasting your intent and then using effect dice.</p>

<p>If you spend a Plot Point, you may keep another of your remaining dice—after adding up the total—as a second effect die. Your targets each get a reaction roll as usual. Your single total applies to each target. It's possible that one target may roll higher than your total while a second loses to you. You can choose to use each effect die for a different kind of effect, so long as it's in line with your original intent. Thus you can create assets for yourself, or inflict stress of different types or multiple complications. You can't inflict the same type of stress with two or more effect dice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As Cyclops, I could have decided to widen the beam of my optic blast to attack both Sentinels. While they would both have been able to roll reactions against me, possibly increasing the likelihood of my getting stress, there's a chance I could have taken them both out. Looking at my roll from earlier, my only option would have been to not increase my total from 12 to 14, instead keeping the D6 as one of my two effect dice (a D10 and a D6).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some special effects (SFX) allow area attacks without spending Plot Points; these allow you to add a D6 to your pool and keep an additional effect die after the roll, one for each target. The downside to this is that it increases the likelihood of complications.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cyclops has the AREA ATTACK SFX for his OPTIC BEAM Power Set, meaning I could have added a bonus D6 to my pool and kept an extra effect die at no cost. I could also have spent a Plot Point to give Cyclops a stunt at D8 (such as "banked shot off the wall and into both Sentinels") and started out with a dice pool of D10 + 3D8 + 3D6. Maybe I should have thought this through earlier…</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>SUPPORTING AND RECOVERY ACTIONS</h3>

<p>Not every hero is right in the thick of things every time. If you're playing a hero who's more of a supporter than a fighter, or more of a fighter than a talker (depending on the action), there's still always something you can do. You might want to help a stressed out teammate recover, or provide covering fire for someone.</p>

<h4>Support Actions</h4>

<p>If you want to use your action to support another hero or supporting character, assemble your dice pool and roll it just as you would normally. This is called a <strong>support action</strong>. The Watcher rolls the doom pool against you. If the Watcher doesn't generate a higher total than yours, you succeed in helping the other character and may use your effect die to create an asset. If you don't succeed, because the Watcher's doom pool generates a higher total than yours, the Watcher might decide to spend the effect die from the doom roll and create a complication for the character you were trying to support.</p>

<h4>Recovery Actions</h4>

<p>A <strong>recovery action</strong> counts as a support action, too. You're rolling to reduce an ally's stress with your effect die, but it's the same process—gather appropriate dice for your dice pool, roll the dice, choose a total and an effect die, and compare the total to the Watcher's doom pool total. Just like any other support action, if you fail to help another character recover stress, the Watcher may spend the effect die from the doom roll and inflict stress or a complication on you or your ally. For more on recovery actions, see page OM24.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let's say Emma Frost's player went before me in the action order, and she wants to help me against the Sentinel. In her Diamond Form, she's blessed with ENHANCED STRENGTH D8 and SUPERHUMAN DURABILITY D10. If she picks up her ENHANCED STRENGTH D8, BUDDY D8, and ICE COLD QUEEN OF THE DISTINCTION at D8, she can roll them all and try to get a better action total than the Watcher's roll on the doom pool. Emma's player describes this as Emma charging forward and bashing at the earth in front of the Sentinel, trying to unbalance it so I get a better shot. The dice come up 5 (D10), 4 (D8), and 4 (D8). Emma's player risks going with a 10 total (from the D8 and the D8) in order to get a D10 effect die. Luckily, the Watcher's total on the doom pool came up 7. Emma's player announces that I'm next in the action order and hands me the D10 to add to my dice pool.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Support and Recovery Actions by Watcher Characters</h4>

<p>As the Watcher, your characters don't roll against the doom pool. If you want to have one Watcher character aid another, just take a die from an appropriate helping trait and add it to the supported character's next dice pool. This counts as an action for the Watcher character who's doing the supporting, so he can't do anything else in that action order. Recovery actions work the same way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are two Sentinels in this battle, even though only one is pressing the attack. As Watcher, I could decide to have the passive Sentinel hand over a helpful trait like SUPERHUMAN STRENGTH to the acting Sentinel's dice pool, giving it another D10.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember, as the Watcher you can always spend (and thus remove) dice out of the doom pool to improve a Watcher character's chances, to add more dice to the total, or to keep effect dice. All of this can be described in the story as support, too, if it makes sense to you. The key thing to be aware of is that Watcher characters represent something different in any Scene; they're primarily the obstacles, not the protagonists. This is why you as the Watcher spend doom dice and not Plot Points, and why supporting actions are much simpler. Keep the spotlight on the heroes, not your own characters, whenever possible.</p>

<hr>

<h3>TARGETING ASSETS, COMPLICATIONS, AND OTHER TRAITS</h3>

<p>Not everything you want to affect in a big Action Scene is a character. You'll often want to use your powers or natural talents to destroy, eliminate, overcome, or repair something in play that's either causing trouble for you and your allies or helping your opponents. You can target significant objects and conditions with your actions when they're represented in the game by traits.</p>

<h4>Do You Need to Roll?</h4>

<p>First of all, make sure it's actually a trait to begin with. A lot of things in the story don't have dice associated with them because they're a part of the fiction that everyone at the table just agrees on. Lampposts, sidewalks, plate windows, random passersby, bouquets of flowers, newspapers, and other items that aren't immediately important are just context and color. You can make them important by using your effect die to make them assets, or use them as part of your description for stunts, but so long as you have the power to smash a glass window (most people) or rip a lamppost out of the street (anyone with SUPERHUMAN STRENGTH) it shouldn't even require dice.</p>

<p>You also need to check whether the item or condition can even be targeted. You can probably disarm a thug with a BIG GUN D8, but you can't disarm them of being an EXPERT THUG D8. Some Power Sets have a Gear Limit that not only has a specific way to be shutdown by the player or the Watcher, but also may be targeted by opponents. The Watcher has final say on this matter, but present your case to the table and see what happens.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I'm playing Colossus, and I want to disable the Sentinel's energy beam projector. I ask the Watcher if that's possible, and he says sure—the Sentinel's datafile has ENERGY BEAM PROJECTOR D10 listed on it. No sweat!</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Take the Shot!</h4>

<p>Now that you're sure something's an asset, complication, or some other trait, you can target it with an action. This works much like a recovery action. You gather together a dice pool that's appropriate, roll against the doom pool plus a die for the trait you're targeting. If you win, use your effect die against the trait. If your effect die is equal to or larger than the trait you're targeting, it's eliminated. If it's smaller, you step back the trait by one.</p>

<p>If the condition, asset, or another trait is somehow connected to a character who would understandably resist you seizing, destroying, or disabling it, that character becomes the opposition, not the doom pool. You're taking action against him and using your effect die, but it's to shutdown his trait rather than inflict a complication or stress.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since the Sentinel's ENERGY BEAM PROJECTOR is a component of the Sentinel itself, the Sentinel, not the doom pool, is my opposition. The Watcher might still use doom dice to add to the Sentinel's dice pool, of course. Since the ENERGY BEAM PROJECTOR is being targeted, that die is included in the Sentinel's dice pool even if it's not going to use it as part of its reaction. If I succeed and get a D10 or higher effect die, that blaster's history. If I end up with only a D8 or less, I step back the ENERGY BLASTER to a D8.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h3>Everyone Has Limits</h3>

<p>You might have ENHANCED STRENGTH D8, but that doesn't mean you can destroy a car with a mighty punch to the radiator. Your energy powers might give you an ENERGY BLAST D10, but it's not going to bring down a skyscraper (maybe just trash the ground floor lobby). The action you take against an asset, complication, or trait must <strong>fall within the realm of possibility</strong> for you, given your Power Sets and Specialties. Even before you roll the dice, check to see whether the targeted trait is too strong (dice rating) or just untouchable (situation).</p>

<p>The Watcher may rule that you can target an asset, complication, or trait, but that your effect die can only step back the trait's die rating by one if it's equal to or larger, and have no effect at all if it's smaller. This is most often the case when you're targeting something that's just really huge, or it's kind of a toss-up whether your abilities and powers could affect it. A good rule of thumb here is that if your own power is equal to the trait die you're targeting, it falls into this category. This continues even if you've stepped the trait back from its original rating; stepping back something from D10 to D8 doesn't mean your D10 power is now more capable of eliminating the trait, even though the trait's die rating is smaller for the purposes of rolling against it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Colossus has GODLIKE STRENGTH D12, which means he's one of the strongest heroes around. He can rip down small buildings, toss cars clear across town, and punch all the way through a bank vault door. But against something really large or rated with a GODLIKE DURABILITY D12, chances are he can only step it back by one—and only if he has at least a D12 effect die. Plus, while I might step it back by one with a success, I still only get to step it back by one next time, even though it's now a D10.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Automatic Success</h4>

<p>If you have a power that might be useful in eliminating an asset, complication, or some other trait, you might be able to forego the roll entirely and just <strong>spend 1 PP to succeed automatically</strong>. This works the same way heroes with a STAMINA power trait can spend 1 PP to eliminate stress. Most of the time, this only works when your hero has either the time or the freedom to do this without interference, and the Watcher should already have established that you'd need to roll the dice as opposed to simply letting you get what you want.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I tell the Watcher that I'd like Colossus to bust through a REINFORCED DOOR D10. The Watcher might just let me do this, since he knows I've got GODLIKE STRENGTH D12. Or he might ask me to roll against the doom pool and apply an effect die against the door's D10 die rating. If that's the case, I can just spend 1 PP and smash through it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're the Watcher, remember that having amazing powers is a lot of the fun of playing in the Marvel Universe. Unless you've got a good reason, you shouldn't worry too much about having the heroes roll to bust through walls or smash cars. The automatic success rule lets you move quickly through the action and get to the real showdowns between the heroes and villains; it offers them a way out of frustrating situations and lets them show off their powers!</p>

<p>Also, the Watcher's characters can do the same thing by spending dice from the doom pool (the doom die must equal or exceed the value of the targeted power or trait). As a player, that's something to keep in mind when you're webbing up Juggernaut's limbs or creating ice structures around a Sentinel…</p>

<hr>

<h2>HEROISM, HEADACHES, AND HEARTBREAK</h2>

<p>Not every Action Scene is a fight between the heroes and an opposing force made up of villains and thugs. In fact, some of the best Action Scenes don't involve physical stress at all, but focus on what you might call <strong>mental</strong> or <strong>emotional conflict</strong>. For these Scenes, there are still clear lines of opposition. One side wants something that the other side doesn't, or one side wants to do something that the other side opposes. The difference in these Scenes is that intimidation, seduction, manipulation, and diplomacy may each be brought to bear, with or without superpowers to back them up.</p>

<p>Non-physical conflict actions use many of the same rules as combat or physical actions, so everything we've introduced so far is fair game. Actions, reactions, effects, extraordinary successes, and dividing your attention are all just as valid in tense Scenes between Spider-Man and Mary Jane or Tony Stark and Steve Rogers. And any emotionally charged Scene can escalate to a knockdown drag-out fight, depending on who's involved. So keep this in mind as you read on—an Action Scene can be physical, mental, emotional, or any combination of the three.</p>

<h3>MENTAL CONFLICT</h3>

<p>Whether it's a duel of wits or a psychic struggle for control, mental conflict has <strong>mental stress as the primary consequence</strong>. Heroes who engage in mental conflict are attempting to outwit their opponents, distracting them from seeing the truth, or trying to bring them around to a new way of seeing things. Mental conflict doesn't even need to be particularly antagonistic. Every good collegiate debate is a mental conflict.</p>

<p>Even more than for a brawl or firefight, mental conflict requires that the intent of the participants is clear. Are you trying to fool someone into thinking you're someone else? Are you trying to upstage another person on a topic that you're sure you're more of an expert in? You have to put forward what your desired outcome is, and then pick up your dice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I'm playing Kitty Pryde and I'm trying to poke holes in an anti-mutant protestor's logic. After talking with the Watcher, we decide that if I win, the protestor won't change his mind right away but will at least realize he was harboring mistaken and hateful ideas. If I lose, I probably reinforce his prejudices and should get out of there!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a mental conflict, the most common effect is <strong>mental stress</strong>. This can represent anything from wearing down your opponent's ability to resist, confusing your opponent, or making a stronger case for what you want. Once you stress out your opponent, you have them where you want them. Don't forget, you can pull your punches when it comes to stressing someone out. This is a wise choice to make if you don't want to inflict mental trauma. See page OM24 for more on pulling your punches when inflicting stress.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As Kitty Pryde, the mental stress I inflict on the anti-mutant protestor represents conflicting arguments, confusing him, and keeping him from pushing his own agenda. If I stress him out, I'll pull my punches and so I don't give him trauma, but I think it will be an epiphany of sorts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Complications are also potential effects, especially when, instead of stress, you want to inflict something like DISTRACTED, OUTWITTED, SCIENTIFIC FALLACY, or TOO MUCH INFORMATION on them. Complications, like stress, can make life difficult for your opponent but won't actually get you what you want unless the player or the Watcher decides to throw in the towel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I could choose to inflict a complication on the anti-mutant protestor, something like HE'S A RAVING LUNATIC or UNPOPULAR OPINION. Those would be interesting, but I'm trying to change his way of thinking, not just saddle him with annoying perceptions.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>USING TRAITS IN NON-COMBAT CONFLICT</h3>

<p>Powers and Specialties can be added into the dice pool when attempting to win a mental or emotional conflict. Psychic powers like TELEPATHY or MIND CONTROL are great. PSYCHIC BLAST is more of a traditional combat power, but it can be a great last resort. If it's psychic or emotion-based as a rule, it can be brought into any non-combat conflict as a means of pushing your hero's agenda or fighting off the ambitions of your opponents. See page OM70 for more on Power Sets.</p>

<p>Specialties that work best in mental and emotional conflicts include MEDICAL, MYSTIC, PSYCH, and SCIENCE. If it's a conflict over knowledge or understanding, any Specialty that covers that area of knowledge is perfect. For more on using Specialties see page OM96.</p>

<p>Don't forget that many heroic Milestones are dependent on non-combat interaction with others; they pose interesting choices that can be worked into these kinds of Scenes. For more on Milestones see page OM10.</p>

<h3>LOSING CONTROL AND PLAYER AGENCY</h3>

<p>It's easier to understand being knocked out in a pitched battle with the forces of Hydra than it is to wrap your head around losing control of your character's emotions or mental state. Roleplaying games are about getting into character and making decisions for a heroic person, right? When the rules tell you that you have to make decisions you didn't want to make, or when the rules make those decisions for you, it can seem worse than having your hero get clobbered.</p>

<p>In this game, the big decisions are yours to make. There are two ways to handle it when your hero is stressed out mentally, emotionally, or both. The first is that you can just let the Watcher describe what happens, and trust that the situation's going to change again soon. Since a stressed out character can't actually do anything like rolling dice or taking action, your character might temporarily take a bit of a back seat to the story. Alternatively, the Watcher might skip to a new Scene, where you've recovered your stress and now you're back in control but dealing with trauma.</p>

<p>The other option is to play it up! If you know what your opponent wanted you to do, you can take direction from that and make decisions for your hero that have that in mind. You can even do this when you haven't been stressed out yet, but you're wrestling with high levels of mental or emotional stress. Describe how your hero paces back and forth, angry and frustrated. Or have your hero lost in despair, opening up his heart to the manipulative villain. It's still an interesting story, and this way you're still in charge. And if you do choose to play it out, the Watcher might reward an exceptional performance with a Plot Point, especially if it lines up with one of your Distinctions or Limits.</p>

<p>If you're being mind controlled or possessed, the same applies. Mind control starts out as influence (a complication) that can lead to full-on domination ("stressed out" by complication). Villains with mind control powers, like the Purple Man, usually try to have heroes do things that they otherwise wouldn't do, or keep them from doing things they want or need to do. Fighting this kind of influence is equivalent to making a recovery action, but you're not rolling against the doom pool. Instead, the character with mind control powers opposes, keeping you from stepping back or eliminating that mental stress.</p>

<p>If you're the Watcher, keep all of the above in mind when you're playing villains with the power to control minds or make heroes their unwilling slaves. It's perfectly reasonable for a player to get upset at losing control, so remind them that it's temporary and that it's a great way to earn Plot Points via Distinctions or Limits. The good thing about mental and emotional conflict is that the players have an opportunity to resist it, so it's never just a sudden switch. Like any other situation, make it a good story, drop the heroes in danger and conflict, and give them a way out.</p>

<h3>EMOTIONAL CONFLICT</h3>

<p>Anything from intimidation to taunting to seductive manipulation can be chalked up to an emotional conflict where <strong>emotional stress is the primary consequence</strong>. If you're using emotional conflict, you want to change your opponents' emotional state, getting them angry, afraid, insecure, or flustered. If they don't object to having their emotional state changed, then there's not really any conflict. Emotional conflict only happens when emotions are at the heart of a divide.</p>

<p><strong>Emotional stress</strong> is irrational and heavy with melodrama, but what it really means is that your opponent's emotions are clouding his judgment or getting in the way of rational thinking. This is different from just being outwitted or tricked, which is mental stress. No, this is crazy gut reaction material, the kind of stress that brings dark clouds or fiery moods. If you stress out your opponent with emotional stress, chances are he's reduced to an angry, insecure, frustrated, or terrified mess. Or, if you've been pulling your punches and were clear in your goals, he's unable to stand in your way.</p>

<p>Before you launch into an action with emotional consequences, you need to figure out what those consequences are. If you're trying to scare your opponent, what happens if his reaction gets a higher total than yours? What's the thing you want to get out of scaring him? If you're trying to seduce the business executive, is failure going to end up with you being embarrassed, the executive getting mad, or worse?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I'm playing Wolverine and I'M THE BEST THERE IS AT WHAT I DO. When I'm trying to scare the living daylights out of one of these anti-mutant protestors bothering Kitty, I need to be careful not to make things worse for mutants, so I decide to be subtle and just use my body language and a couple of grunts to give the guy reason to leave.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, as Wolverine, I rolled so well in my emotional conflict action that I stressed the anti-mutant protestor out in one go (having SFX that step up emotional stress I inflict also helps). The Watcher agrees that this means he's taken off at a brisk run, convinced that he shouldn't be attending rallies like this when scary people with claws are present. If I had only inflicted emotional stress but not stressed him out, he might have stayed around, but his rattled nerves would have hindered his activity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Complications are also potential effects, especially when, instead of stress, you want to inflict something like REALLY BAD NEWS, ROMANTIC OVERTURES, SIBLING RIVALRY, and EMBARRASSING REVELATIONS. Each of these gets in the way of your opponents' activity but won't stress them out by themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I could have chosen to inflict both emotional stress and a complication on the protestor if I'd spent a PP to keep another effect die. As it happened, stressing him out did the trick.</p>
