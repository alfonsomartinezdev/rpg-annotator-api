<h2>OBJECT CLASS: EUCLID</h2>

<h2>SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:</h2>

<p>SCP-3847 is to be contained in a standard secure document storage facility at Site-██. Access requires Level 3
  clearance and approval from Dr. Meridian or Senior Research Staff. All personnel interacting with SCP-3847 must
  undergo psychological evaluation within 72 hours of exposure.</p>

<p>The artifact is to be stored in a climate-controlled environment at 21°C with humidity maintained at 45%. Under no
  circumstances should SCP-3847 be exposed to direct electromagnetic radiation above 500 nanometers wavelength.</p>

<p><strong>ADDENDUM 3847-A</strong>: Following Incident 3847-7, all research sessions are limited to 4-hour intervals
  with mandatory 48-hour rest periods between exposures.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>

<p>SCP-3847 is a leather-bound manuscript of unknown origin, measuring 32cm x 24cm x 8cm. The cover bears no external
  markings save for a series of geometric symbols that change configuration when observed directly. Carbon dating
  indicates the materials are approximately 800 years old, though certain ink compounds contain isotopes that should not
  exist naturally.</p>

<p>The manuscript contains 247 pages of text written in what appears to be a hybrid of Medieval Latin and an unknown
  symbolic language. Translation efforts led by Dr. Elena Vasquez have revealed the document to be a comprehensive
  archive of astronomical observations, focusing particularly on celestial events occurring during what the text refers
  to as "convergence points."</p>

<p>Most concerning are the detailed star charts depicting constellations that do not match any known stellar
  configurations, yet demonstrate mathematical precision exceeding our current astronomical instruments. Several charts
  contain annotations in modern English, despite the manuscript's apparent age.</p>

<h2>DISCOVERY:</h2>

<p>SCP-3847 was recovered from the estate of deceased astrophysicist Dr. Marcus Chen following his disappearance in
  ████. Local authorities had been investigating reports of unusual electromagnetic disturbances emanating from Dr.
  Chen's private observatory. Foundation agents embedded in the ███████ Police Department intercepted the case after
  detecting Class-C cognitohazardous effects among responding officers.</p>

<p>The manuscript was found open to page 127, which contains a detailed diagram of what Dr. Chen's notes identify as
  "The Threshold Configuration" - a specific astronomical alignment referenced throughout his research logs.</p>

<h2>NOTABLE INCIDENTS:</h2>

<p><strong>Incident 3847-1 (██/██/████)</strong>: Research Assistant Collins reported temporal displacement while
  transcribing page 89. Security footage confirms Collins was absent from the research chamber for 6 hours despite his
  perception of only 20 minutes having passed.</p>

<p><strong>Incident 3847-3 (██/██/████)</strong>: Dr. Meridian observed spontaneous appearance of additional text on
  page 203 during routine documentation. The new text appeared to be written in Dr. Chen's handwriting and contained
  coordinates matching the location of [REDACTED].</p>

<p><strong>Incident 3847-7 (██/██/████)</strong>: Multiple personnel reported shared dreams featuring an astronomical
  observatory "between the spaces of stars." These dreams preceded the discovery of Dr. Chen's hidden research facility
  by 72 hours.</p>

<h2>RESEARCH NOTES:</h2>

<p>Dr. Meridian's analysis has identified recurring motifs throughout the text:</p>

<ul>
  <li>References to "The Watchers" - entities or individuals apparently responsible for maintaining astronomical records
    across centuries</li>
  <li>Detailed observations of stellar phenomena occurring in 3-year cycles, with particular emphasis on dates that
    align with documented anomalous events in Foundation records</li>
  <li>Mathematical formulae that demonstrate correlation with the Kozlov-Hammond equations from Project STARBRIDGE</li>
  <li>Multiple references to "subsidiary archives" located at coordinates that correspond to other known anomalous sites
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Translation Progress</strong>: 34% complete. Dr. Vasquez estimates full translation will require an
  additional 18 months, assuming continued cooperation from the artifact's anomalous properties.</p>

<p><strong>Cross-Reference Priority</strong>: High correlation with SCP-████, SCP-████, and objects recovered during
  Operation NIGHTFALL. Recommend immediate consultation with the Department of Astronomical Anomalies.</p>

<h2>PERSONNEL NOTES:</h2>

<p><em>Dr. Sarah Meridian, Lead Researcher</em>: "The mathematical precision of these star charts is unlike anything in
  our historical records. More troubling is the apparent real-time updating of certain passages. I suspect SCP-3847 is
  not merely a record of astronomical events, but an active component in a larger system we do not yet understand."</p>

<p><em>Dr. Elena Vasquez, Lead Translator</em>: "The linguistic structure suggests multiple authors across different
  time periods, yet the handwriting remains consistent throughout. Several passages reference events that occurred after
  Dr. Chen's disappearance, written in his distinctive script."</p>
